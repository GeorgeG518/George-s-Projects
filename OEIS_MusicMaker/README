Just a short project that I came up with to muck with the OEIS. Some mucking features as of 10/8/21:
  Pulls OEIS sequence randomly, with keywords, or with code directly into python tangible data types  
  plots sequences specified
  Takes sequences and converts them into a MIDI file, similarly to the actual website [which I didn't know it could do]
    Mainly did this for my FL Studio projects.
